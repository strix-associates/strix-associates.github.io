									<h3 class="major">Strategy . Product . Digital </h3>
									<p>Welcome to Strix Associates. Founded by a seasoned professional with over 15 years of invaluable experience in digital transformation, software development and life sciences technology, we pride ourselves on distilling intricate concepts into accessible, actionable strategies.</p>

									<p>We understand the unique challenges faced by organisations operating within the tech arena, from navigating difficult routes to market to communicating complex technical advancements to diverse audiences. Our broad experience across both the private and public sectors allows us to look at any challenge from a strategic view point and offer fresh insights.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How we work</h3>
									<p>We work with senior stakeholders in businesses to understand their needs from a holistic standpoint. We can undertake long-term projects, building a deep understanding of the business and working as partners to achieve long term goals, or act as a targeted task force, concentrating on a particular challenge with focus and clarity. Either way we make sure we deliver real, valuable outcomes, not just a checklist of deliverables.</p>

									<p>Our first step is always to talk through your needs so we can build you a package of services that reflects all of what you need, and none of what you don't. If you think we could be the right consultancy for you drop us a line - we'd love to talk with you.</p>
